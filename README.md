# Numcalcium
## Electrical Engineer's Friend :)
USB Calculator and numpad with build in tools to help you create and debug circuits easier.

## Dependencies
Using a modified STM32 library for the arduino core, one is able to build and flash the unit with the latest build, *[or use the prebuilt binary file and upload utility] - coming soon*

## Hardware 
The board contains an STM32F103C8 64kb program space and 20kb sram.
